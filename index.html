	 <h2>About Me</h2>
	 <p>There's not much for me to say about me, I do my college that are assigned by my instructor and get them done when they are due. I do have hobbies that consist of collecting figures, doing smartphone screen replacments, and playing games online with friends and having fun while doing so. I do enjoy this class very much and have learned quite a bit from taking computer classes, go to show you can learn a lot if you put your mind to it.</p>
