	<p><h4>The navagtion bar up above is something I used that was similar to make my first website, although it isn't the same one, it's still looks decent enough to my original one.</h4></p>
	<p><h4>I also included an image of an up arrow to show my navigation bar with some icons. I will mosty likey swap out that bar at a later date as it doesn't really do anything when you click on the icons, for now it's just a placeholder to show what I can do.</h4></p>
	<p><h4>As you can also see that I've also aligned my image to be in the center as well using a combination of HTML and CSS to align the image.</h4></p>
<p><h4>Thanks for checking out my page! Hope you found something interesting while going through my page and looking through my code.</h4></p>
